# Hindi-language-interface-to-database
In our everyday lives we require information to accomplish daily tasks. Database is one
of the most important sources of information. Database systems have been widely used in data
storage and retrieval. However, to extract information from databases, we need to have some
knowledge of database languages like SQL. But SQL has predefined structures and format, so
it is hard for the non-expert users to formulate the desired query. To override this complexity,
we have turned to natural language to retrieve information from database, which can be an ideal
channel between a non-technical user and the application. But the application cannot understand
natural language so an interface is required. This interface is capable of converting the user’s
natural language query to an equivalent database language query. In this paper, we address the
system architecture for translating a Hindi sentence in the form of an audio to an equivalent
SQL query. The users don’t need to learn any formal query language; hence it’s easy to use for
common people.
